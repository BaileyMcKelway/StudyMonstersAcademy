# Examples:

Teach your monster everything is knows!

## Your monster creates notes based on what you teach it.

## Once you have three notes it can write an essay

## Then you can have conversations about what you taught it!

## But be careful because your monsters will learn exactly what you teach it. Even if it is not true!
